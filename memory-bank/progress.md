## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

- [x] Deployment & Automation
  - **Kubernetes Deployments:**
    - AI service and frontend are deployed via `k8s/ai-service-deployment.yaml` and `k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml`.
    - Both use secure pod settings, resource limits, health checks, secrets, and persistent storage.
    - HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) for both services enables auto-scaling based on CPU/memory.
    - Ingress for frontend includes SSL and security headers.
  - **Monitoring:**
    - Monitoring is automated using `k8s/monitoring/app-monitoring.yaml`.
    - PodMonitors for Prometheus scrape metrics from AI and frontend pods.
    - AlertmanagerConfig and Prometheus rules enable Slack alerting and SLO monitoring.
    - Grafana dashboards are provisioned via ConfigMap.
  - **Backup & Recovery:**
    - Daily and weekly backups are scheduled via `k8s/maintenance/backup-config.yaml` using Velero and CronJobs for database/model backups to S3.
    - Disaster recovery is automated via `k8s/maintenance/disaster-recovery.yaml` (Velero restore configs, restore jobs, and step-by-step procedures in ConfigMap).
  - **What Needs Scripting/CI/CD:**
    - CI/CD pipeline configuration for image builds, tests, and auto-deploys is not present in repo and should be added (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or ArgoCD).
    - Manual steps may include updating image tags, running pipeline triggers, and secret management.

  **Guidance for future developers:**
  - Update YAMLs for new services or resources.
  - Add CI/CD pipeline scripts to automate image builds, tests, and kubectl apply steps.
  - Review and test backup/restore jobs regularly.
  - Document any manual steps in the recovery ConfigMap or team wiki.

- [x] Testing
  - Implemented comprehensive test suite
    - Unit Tests
      - Face Detection: Covered no face, single face, multiple faces, gaze direction, movement, and error handling (see face_detection_test.py)
      - Gaze Tracking: Covered eye landmark detection, gaze direction, attention monitoring, and violation logic (see gaze_tracking_test.py)
      - Object Detection: Covered YOLOv5 integration, prohibited object detection, tracking, and confidence scoring (see object_detection_test.py)
      - Audio Processing: Covered voice detection, silence, noise, whisper, sound classification, noise filtering, normalization, frequency analysis, and segmentation (see audio_processing.test.py)
      - All AI model tests are robust, pass as of 2025-09-10, and use synthetic/dummy data for reliability.
    - Integration Tests
      - API and WebSocket integration, error handling, authentication, and security are covered in ai_service/__tests__/api_integration.test.py.
      - Includes health checks, endpoint validation, rate limiting, and WebSocket protocol/security.
    - Load Tests
      - k6/security-load-tests.js simulates authentication, WebSocket proctoring, rate limiting, RBAC, and API key validation under concurrent user load.
      - Tests system behavior at scale and enforces error/latency thresholds.
    - End-to-End (E2E) Tests
      - No e2e test scripts found in frontend/cypress/e2e. Future developers should add Cypress or Playwright tests for user flows.
  
  **Guidance for future developers:**
  - Extend integration tests by adding new API/WebSocket scenarios to api_integration.test.py.
  - Expand load tests in k6/security-load-tests.js for new endpoints or roles.
  - Add e2e tests in frontend/cypress/e2e for UI-driven user flows and regression protection.
  - Maintain synthetic data and strict assertions for reliability and reproducibility.
      - Note for future developers: To extend or maintain tests, add new scenarios to the respective test files and keep dependency versions (numpy, scipy, typing-extensions) compatible with OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Ultralytics.
