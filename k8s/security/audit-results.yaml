    # Security Recommendations

    ## High Priority
    1. Regular secret rotation
       - Implement automated secret rotation
       - Monitor secret access patterns
       - Alert on unusual access patterns

    2. Enhanced monitoring
       - Add AI-based anomaly detection
       - Implement behavioral analysis
       - Enhance security metrics

    3. Security automation
       - Automate security scanning
       - Implement automated response
       - Add continuous security testing

    ## Medium Priority
    1. Additional security features
       - Implement IP whitelisting
       - Add MFA for critical operations
       - Enhance audit logging

    2. Security documentation
       - Create incident response runbooks
       - Document security procedures
       - Update security training

    ## Low Priority
    1. Future improvements
       - Consider security mesh implementation
       - Plan zero-trust architecture
       - Evaluate additional security tools
